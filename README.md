# Off-by-One Error in Java Array

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The error arises from an incorrect loop condition, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version. This example highlights the importance of careful attention to array bounds when programming in Java.
